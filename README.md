# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

* Excellent communication
* Asks the right questions
* Resourceful

Sarah Creager Strengths:

* CSS
* Layouts and page wireframes
* UI/UX

* Leadership
* Project management

Kyle Cohen Strengths: 

* Wireframe/whiteboarding
* CSS design
* Team cohesion

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
We're going to work together to highlight our strengths and utilize them in this project.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

* Planning and estimating
* Technical

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Pair programming, switching between 1 driver and 2 navigators

### Conflict Resolution:

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Raise concern to the group as soon as possible. If that does not solve the problem we will go to the TA, then JB.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Raise concern to the group as soon as possible. If that does not solve the problem we will go to the TA, then JB.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* be considerate of different skill levels and learning styles
* shift perspective from "just finishing the project" to using this as an opportunity to grow, teach, and learn
